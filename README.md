# Zomato-PySpark-Project

#### This project not only explores the capabilities of PySpark for data manipulation and analysis but also integrates advanced techniques to derive meaningful insights from the Zomato dataset. Depending on your interests and objectives, you can emphasize different aspects such as visualization, modeling, or deployment to make the project more comprehensive and impactful.

### Project Outline

#### 1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Load the Zomato dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.
   - Explore the schema and understand the data types.
   - Check for missing values, handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., numeric fields).

#### 2. **Data Preparation**
   - Preprocess the data for analysis and modeling.
   - Select relevant features for the project (e.g., restaurant ID, location, cuisine, ratings).
   - Ensure categorical variables are encoded properly if needed (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical features).
